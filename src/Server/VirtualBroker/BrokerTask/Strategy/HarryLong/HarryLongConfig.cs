But 2017-02-14: switched to TVIX, because of forced "SHORT STOCK POSITION BOUGHT IN" without advance notice.

        //QuickTester shows the expected performance changes if we replace TVIX with 2x SVXY.
        //>short TVIX: 35% ? no idea, buggy data, but it can be estimated by shorting UVXY:
        //>Start Date: 2011-10-04
        //> -35% short UVXY: CAGR: 105.88%	Annualized StDev: 50.02%	Sharpe: 2.12, (this is almost like TVIX), however -6% shorting borrowing fee = 99% CAGR.This was played until 2017-12-12. However, TVIX requires margin of 4x.So, if you play 10K short TVIX, the margin required is 40K.
        //> -70% short VXX: CAGR: 100.01%	Annualized StDev: 50.05%	Sharpe: 2   this is the synthetic one, if played by short VXX.However, short VXX requires margin of x2.3
        //> 70% long XIV: CAGR: 87.29%	Annualized StDev: 50.17%	Sharpe: 1.74
        //> 70% long SVXY: CAGR: 87.18%	Annualized StDev: 50.3%	Sharpe: 1.73.  I will use this SVXY.Don't touch the XIV position which is long term. It requiers margin of x1.0
        //So, should we change TVIX to 2x SVXY ? No, because perfarmance is decreased from 99% to 87% CAGR.
        //>-However, I have no other option.There are IB Margin problems.
        //>-And this way, it would be safer if VIX triples in 1 day.
        //>-Also forced liquidation risk is eliminated.
        //>-Also missing trades are eliminated when there is no TVIX available for shorting.
        //>-In brief, this is the less performance, but safer trade.Let's do SVXY.
