    <h1>Systematic Withdrawal Simulator Help v0.2</h1>
    This is our Systematic Withdrawal Simulator. In fact, it is a combination of a <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp">Dollar-cost Averaging</a> Calculator and a <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/systematicwithdrawalschedule.asp">Systematic Withdrawal</a> Calculator.
    <h2>Description</h2>

    The simulator has two main parts: deposits and withdrawals.<br> After an initial deposit, further additional recurring deposits can be done, optionally. It should be decided, how often, how long and how much additional money to invest.<br>
    Besides that, scheduled systematic withdrawals can also be done. It should be decided, from when, how often and what percentage of the total portfolio value to withdraw.<br><br>
    This simulator uses normally distributed random daily percentage changes during calculations. Expected value and standard deviation of daily percentage changes can be set up in input parameters part (in annualized terms).
   
    <h2>Inputs</h2>
    <h3>Base parameters</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><u>Length of simulation in years:</u> Can be chosen between 1 and 50 years.</li>
        <li><u>CAGR of the investment:</u> Historical CAGR of our UberVXX strategy is 133.7% (from 2004-03-26 until 2016-10-28). As it is a highly-optimized strategy, expected future CAGR should be around 50%. Historical CAGR of buy and hold SPX is 7.5%.</li>
        <li><u>StdDev annualized:</u> Historical standard deviation of our UberVXX strategy is 41.5% (from 2004-03-26 until 2016-10-28). Historical standard deviation of buy and hold SPX is 15.5%.</li>
        <li><u>Number of simulations:</u> Can be chosen between 1 and 99,999. At least 50 and no more than 1,000 simulations are recommended.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Deposits</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><u>Initial deposit $:</u> The value of initial deposit at start of simulation can be chosen between $1 and $999,999.</li>
        <li><u>Additional deposit frequency in months (optional):</u> Can be chosen between 1 and 60 months (5 years). It should be left empty if there is no additional deposit. Additional deposit will be made at the end of every period.</li>
        <li><u>Additional deposit $ (optional):</u> This amount will be added to the portfolio at the end of every period. Can be chosen between $1 and $999,999. It should be left empty if there is no additional deposit.</li>
        <li><u>Additional deposit end month (optional):</u> Last month of additional deposit. If it is lower than the additional deposit frequency, no additional deposit will be made. If it is higher than the length of simulation, additional deposits will be made until the end of the simulation. It should be left empty if there is no additional deposit or it would not be stopped during the simulation.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Withdrawals</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><u>Withdrawal start month (optional):</u> Starting month of systematic withdrawal. It should be left empty if there is no withdrawal.</li>
        <li><u>Withdrawal frequency in months (optional):</u> Can be chosen between 1 and 600 months (50 years). It should be left empty if there is no withdrawal. Withdrawals will be made at the end of every period.</li>
        <li><u>Withdrawal % (optional):</u> The percentage of systematic withdrawal, which ratio of portfolio value will be withdrawed at the end of every withdrawal period. Can be chosen between 1% and 99%. It should be left empty if there is no withdrawal.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Outputs</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><u>Total deposit:</u> The sum of the initial and additional deposits.</li>
        <li><u>Types of portfolios:</u> <ul>
            <li><i>Average:</i> The average of portfolio values using all the simulations.</li>
            <li><i>Median:</i> The median of portfolio values using all the simulations.</li>
            <li><i>Random Example:</i> The portfolio value of a randomly selected simulation.</li>
            </ul></li>
        <li><u>Strategy without withdrawal:</u> In this case, no withdrawal is made. It is a simple buy and hold strategy.</li>
        <li><u>Strategy with withdrawal:</u> In this case, systematic withdrawal is made. There is two sub-portfolios: 'Withdrawed' and 'Still invested'.<ul>
                <li><i>Withdrawed:</i> This sub-portfolio contains the already withdrawed money. This is a passive sub-portfolio without additional returns.</li>
                <li><i>Still invested:</i> This sub-portfolio contains our still invested money at the end of simulation. </li>
                <li><i>Total:</i> The aggregation of 'Withdrawed' and 'Still invested' sub-portfolios.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h2>Example</h2>
    We would like to simulate our UberVXX strategy for 10 years. Our expected CAGR is 50%, while annualized standard deviation is 40% (Thus, Sharpe ratio is around 1.25.). We are using 100 different yield curves.<br><br>
    Our initial deposit is $1,000 and we are adding further $100 every half a year in the first 5 years. Furthermore, we are withdrawing the 10% of total portfolio value at the end of each year (including the first year).

    <h3>Interpretation of results   </h3>
    During the simulation, $2,000 was deposited in total. <br><br>
    If withdrawals had not been applied, average profit would have been $170,187 or 8,509.3% during the 10 years, which is 56.1% CAGR. Median values would have been $71,914; 3,595.7% and 43.4%, respectively. Using a randomly selected yield curve from the 100 simulations, average profit would be $84,426 or 4,221.3%, which is 45.7% CAGR. <br><br>
    Using withdrawals, in average case our total profit would decrease significantly to $80,822 (or to $35,944 in case of median or to $44,709 in case of the randomly selected yield curve). In terms of CAGR, it would decrease with 11% to 45.1% on average. However, over the years $20,282 profit has been realized, which is tenfold the total deposit.<br><br>
    Based on these figures, using systematic withdrawals in real life should be recommended.
